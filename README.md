# CryptAI

CryptAI is a conversational crypto transaction platform that eliminates the friction of traditional wallet interactions. Instead of navigating complex interfaces, switching networks, and manually signing transactions, users can simply type their intent in natural human language — and CryptAI takes care of the rest.

The project is being developed for integration with AYA Wallet, providing a unified and secure wallet experience that can work across multiple blockchains. Currently, the system is live on one chain, with a roadmap to expand to all major chains and tokens.

## Problem

Even experienced crypto users face unnecessary complexity when sending funds:

* Switching between multiple wallets and chain networks.
* Copy-pasting long wallet addresses.
* Manually signing and verifying transactions.
* Technical onboarding barriers for new users.

This complexity slows adoption and prevents crypto from being as accessible as sending money in a messaging app.

## Solution

CryptAI transforms the process into a simple conversation:

**Example:** “Send 0.05 ETH to Alex”
**Response:** “✅ Sent! Transaction hash: 0x123…abcd”
