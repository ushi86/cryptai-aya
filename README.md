### **Project Title**
CryptAI – Conversational Crypto Transactions for AYA Wallet

### **One-Sentence Elevator Pitch**

Send crypto to anyone in plain human language - no wallet switching, no chain setup, just chat and transact.

### **Detailed Project Description**

CryptAI is a conversational crypto transaction platform that removes the friction from blockchain payments.
Instead of navigating multiple wallets, switching chain networks, or manually signing each transaction, users simply type their intent in natural language - for example:

> “Send 0.05 ETH to Alex”
> “Pay 10 USDC to Priya for lunch”

The system processes the request, parses the intent, and executes the transaction via AYA Wallet.
Currently, CryptAI is live on one blockchain, with plans to expand to all major chains.

### **Key Features:**

- Natural language transaction commands.
- Single, unified wallet experience via AYA Wallet.
- Secure transaction signing.
- Scalable for multi-chain and multi-token support.

### **Currently Live on:**

[https://cryptai-eight.vercel.app/](https://cryptai-eight.vercel.app/)


### **How it Works**

```
Send 1 SUI to 0x123abc...789
```
The app will parse the intent and execute the transaction via AYA Wallet.

The transaction hash will be displayed on-screen.

### **Known Issues**
- Currently supports only one blockchain network.
- No voice command support yet.
- Requires pre-funded wallet to execute transactions.

### **Update 1.1**

- Now support all evm based chains
